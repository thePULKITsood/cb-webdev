"strongly typed language   VS     weekly typed language "
// typed means the data type  ! ! 




// L-value: “l-value” refers to memory location which identifies an object.
//  l-value may appear as either left hand or right hand side of an assignment operator(=)
//  . l-value often represents as identifier.

// An lvalue (locator value) represents an object that occupies
//  some identifiable location in memory (i.e. has an address).

// rvalues are defined by exclusion. 
// Every expression is either an lvalue or an rvalue, so
// , an rvalue is an expression that does not 
// represent an object occupying some identifiable location in memory.


//    the restrictionn of data type is on the variable and not on the value


//    ins strongly typed languages the l value has data types as well 
//     means the poitner to the location in the memory also have data types 

//      but in weekly typed languages the pointers or the le values dont have a a data type 


// oy

// statically vs dynamically typed laguages ! ! 

// in statically typed languages the errors can be chaecked at compile time  if iam using some wrong 
// data type for a function or something that dosnt work with that data type 


// in dynamically typed language i there can be run time errors but compile time pe it can pass 


java script == weekly + dianamically typed language
